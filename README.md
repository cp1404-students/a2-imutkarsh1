# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
ans- Someone with experience in Python and the Kivy framework would be able to complete it faster than a beginner. it took me around 2 weeks to complete it.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
ans- Thing from which i most satisifed is 
Functionality: The application meets all the requirements set out in the brief.
Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices and design patterns.
Learning Outcome: Gained new skills or improved existing skills in Python and Kivy.
User Experience: Created a user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
ans - Time Management: The project may have taken longer than expected due to various challenges.
Complexity: Some parts of the code may be more complex than necessary, making it harder to maintain or modify.
Scalability: The current design might not scale well with a significantly larger collection of songs or additional features

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

ans - Time Management: Effectively prioritizing tasks and managing time can lead to a more productive development process.
Clear Requirements: Understanding the project's requirements from the start can streamline the development process and ensure that all functionalities align with the expected outcomes.


## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

ans- pend more time in the planning phase to create detailed wireframes and flowcharts before jumping into coding. This can save time later on by reducing the need for major changes.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

ans - i used some yt videos to get some help.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
ans- Understanding Kivy Framework
Challenge: Kivy has its own way of handling layouts, events, and properties which might be different from other Python frameworks.
Overcome: Invest time in reading the Kivy documentation, follow tutorials, and build simple starter applications to get familiar with the core concepts.

Designing the GUI
Challenge: Designing a user-friendly and functional GUI requires understanding the nuances of user experience design.
Overcome: Sketch out the design beforehand and use Kivy's interactive launcher for quick prototyping. Getting user feedback early can also guide the design process.

Managing State
Challenge: Keeping track of which songs have been learned and which haven't, especially when the application is closed and reopened.
Overcome: Use Kivy properties and ensure that the state is saved to a file, like a JSON, whenever changes are made. Load this state when the application starts.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
